<!-- to create layout we could use display inline block
 but that causes the alignemnt problem 
 suppose a div has width 300px
 inside it we have two elements 
 a has 50px
 b has 250px we wont be able to have both in the div as inline block
 we can see the same using background color
 there a space taken by mutliple spaces in html code
 however we can remove the spacing in html which would then cause less readabilty as all element are very closed to each other 
 
 the other problem is it is not vertically aligned 

 we will use css grid that let us have perfeclty aligned horizontal layout
